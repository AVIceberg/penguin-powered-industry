Penguin-Powered Industry is a click-based economy game in which the user plays as Santa Claus, scrambling to make enough toys in time for Christmas Eve. Users can sign up / login, at which point they will be redirected to their ‘game page’. From there, users can click to gain currency or they can manage their growing industrial nightmare. Each user has an associated map in which they can place buildings, investing in infrastructure and workers to increase their toy accumulation. In addition, users are bombarded with events occurring around their map and must make decisions to deal with them - often involving trade-offs of short-term and long-term gains, all while the clock ticks down on the game’s finale. The game is singleplayer in nature, but users compete indirectly through online leaderboards accessible through the site.

‘Clicker games’ are a type of game whose gameplay largely involves the completion and repetition of simple actions (usually clicking) to receive currency. This currency is then used to purchase upgrades or buildings that increase the rate of currency gain or provide a passive income of such.

 As of now, there are a multitude of these games, with Cookie Clicker being the most famous and most well-received. However, despite the continued popularity of the genre amongst certain demographics, they all possess a fairly significant attrition rate which can be tied, in our opinion, to two specific aspects of the game.

The first aspect, although the less significant, is their never-ending nature. Clicker games, by and large, continue on forever. Since new content cannot be generated forever, the initial goals of the game - purchasing upgrades and buildings - either seizes completely or slows down to a point where progress seems unviable, leading the player to walk away in boredom or frustration.

The second aspect, and by far the more difficult to deal with, is the monotony - it is, after all, a genre that revolves around mindless repetition. Although several games have made an effort to curb the monotony with achievements and power-ups, they are a band-aid that sours after sufficient game time.

Penguin-Powered Industry is an attempt to resolve both of these issues with the genre while maintaining the aspects that make these games easy to pick up and impossible to put down - namely, the simple, unchallenging nature of the gameplay combined with a unique theme and aesthetic.

In Penguin-Powered Industry, you play as Santa Claus. With only a few weeks to go before Christmas Eve, you find yourself without help -- the elves are all on strike! As meeting their demands is simply ludicrous, you scramble to make the toys yourself, engaging in horrifying abuses of penguin and environmental rights to ensure you meet your deadline.

Unlike in most clicker games, the user is immediately granted an end goal and a deadline: They need to produce X toys within the given time frame or else they will lose. In doing so, we provide the user a sense of urgency and instill them with purpose, whereas most clicker games rely upon a sense of curiosity to do the same.

To achieve this goal, the users must purchase buildings which act as currency generators. To do so, they must choose a building from the shop at the cost of toys and place it somewhere on their map; if that location is valid (i.e., does not possess a building currently), the building will immediately appear. At the beginning these buildings are unmanned and, as such, are utterly useless, but the user can purchase penguin workers which will increase their efficiency. Your penguin workers can be further upgraded in the shop, equipping them with robotic enhancements and horrifying mutations to increase their efficiency. These upgrades apply to all penguins past and future, and are not individual to specific penguins.

This implementation is significantly different than most clicker games in that there is a physical map in which the user’s buildings exist and, as such, a limit to those buildings. As a result, we provide visceral feedback regarding the user’s progress - more so than a simple number on the screen - and provide a limitation that forces our users to think before they make a purchase. Furthermore, the penguins serve as a more variable element - they can be shipped from building-to-building and rearranged to optimize your toy gains.

There is one more key difference between Penguin-Powered Industry and most clicker games: Events. In Penguin-Powered Industry, events will pop up periodically, pausing the game and offering the user a dialogue window. This window will provide the user with some text explaining the situation - a blizzard, a collapsed toy mine - as well as one or more options (buttons) on how to handle the situation. Some situations, such as a blizzard, might be beyond your control - you simply have to deal with reduced production in affected buildings or an inability to maneuver your penguins between buildings during the storm. Other situations, such as a collapsed toy mine, might provide you with multiple options: Stage a rescue mission, spending large numbers of toys to rescue your trapped penguin miners and reopen the mine, or abandon your miners to their fate and leave the mine to clog up your map.

These three aspects - map, penguins, and events - join together to provide a far more interactive experience than one might usually find in clicker games. The user must make decisions and must plan ahead if they wish to meet their quota and win the game.

Lastly, there is the matter of replayability. When a player wins the game, a window will pop up on the screen, asking whether they want to play again at an increased difficulty. This difficulty will largely be maintained by the number of toys required to complete the game, although the mechanics of the game allow us to make other tweaks to the difficulty if necessary.

Overall, we believe this proposal to be suitable for a group of our size. We believe that we can establish the basic mechanics of the game - the map, buildings, events, and clicking - within the given time limit and using the provided framework, and that we can then continue with additional mechanics such as leaderboards and greater graphical fidelity if time permits.
